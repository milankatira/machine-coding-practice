# Accordion Component

## Goal

To implement a collapsible UI component where clicking a header expands or collapses its associated content. This often involves managing the visibility of content sections and ensuring smooth transitions.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `accordian` directory:
    ```bash
    cd accordian
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser to the address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Edge Cases to Consider

*   **Multiple Open Items:** Should only one item be open at a time, or can multiple be expanded simultaneously?
*   **Initial State:** What is the default state when the component loads (all closed, first one open)?
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes are correctly implemented.
*   **Content Overflow:** How does the accordion handle content that is very long or contains complex elements?
*   **Animation Interruptions:** What happens if a user clicks rapidly during an animation?
