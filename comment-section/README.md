# Comment Section Component

## Goal

To develop a user interface for displaying and adding comments, often with support for nested replies to create a conversational thread.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `comment-section` directory:
    ```bash
    cd comment-section
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser to the address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Edge Cases to Consider

*   **Nested Replies:** How to handle multiple levels of replies and display them clearly.
*   **Editing/Deleting Comments:** Functionality for users to modify or remove their own comments.
*   **User Authentication:** How to associate comments with specific users.
*   **Pagination/Loading More:** For a large number of comments, how to load them efficiently.
*   **Input Validation:** Ensuring comments are not empty or exceed a certain length.
*   **Real-time Updates:** How to display new comments without a page refresh.
