# Progress Bar Component

## Goal

To create a visual indicator that shows the progress of an operation, such as a file upload, form submission, or task completion. It typically updates dynamically to reflect the current status.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `progress-bar` directory:
    ```bash
    cd progress-bar
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser to the address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Edge Cases to Consider

*   **Dynamic Updates:** Ensuring smooth and accurate visual updates as the progress value changes.
*   **Indeterminate State:** How to represent a progress bar when the total progress is unknown (e.g., a spinning loader).
*   **Accessibility:** Providing ARIA attributes to convey progress information to screen readers.
*   **Min/Max Values:** Handling progress values outside the 0-100% range.
*   **Animation:** Smooth transitions for the progress bar filling up.
*   **Error States:** How to visually indicate if an operation fails or is interrupted.
