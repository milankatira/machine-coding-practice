# Infinite Scroll Component

## Goal

To implement a UI pattern where more content is loaded automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of a page or container, providing a continuous browsing experience.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `infinite-scroll` directory:
    ```bash
    cd infinite-scroll
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser to the address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Edge Cases to Consider

*   **Scroll Detection:** Accurately detecting when the user has scrolled near the bottom of the scrollable area.
*   **Loading State:** Displaying a loading indicator while new content is being fetched.
*   **No More Content:** What happens when all available content has been loaded?
*   **Error Handling:** How to gracefully handle failures during data fetching.
*   **Performance:** Ensuring smooth scrolling and efficient rendering of large lists.
*   **Initial Load:** How much content to load initially before scrolling is needed.
*   **Debouncing Scroll Events:** Preventing excessive data requests from rapid scrolling.
