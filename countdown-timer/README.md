# Countdown Timer Component

## Goal

To implement a timer that counts down from a specified time (e.g., a few minutes, hours, or days) to zero, updating the display in real-time.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `countdown-timer` directory:
    ```bash
    cd countdown-timer
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser to the address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Edge Cases to Consider

*   **Time Calculation Accuracy:** Ensuring precise time calculation, especially over long durations.
*   **Timer Completion:** What happens when the timer reaches zero (e.g., display a message, trigger an event)?
*   **Pausing/Resuming:** Adding functionality to pause and resume the countdown.
*   **Negative Time:** Preventing the timer from going into negative values if not intended.
*   **Browser Tab Inactivity:** How to handle cases where the browser tab is in the background (timers might slow down).
*   **Initial Time Input:** Validating the initial time provided to the component.
